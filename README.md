## Background:
In 2020 the healthcare sector accounted for 18% of the U.S. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and is one of the largest and most complex in the country. This one sector is comprised of many Industries<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/info/blog/explore-the-healthcare-industry">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>.

</ol>

#### <B>Our Focus</B>:
<B>Healthcare Facilities (Hospitals) </B>

__Key services within the hospital industry include, hospitals, clinics, labs, psychiatric facilities, and nursing homes. These services are provided by millions of providers globally. Approximately 9.2 Million physicians, 19.4 millions nurses and midwives, 1.9 million dentist and dentistry personnel, 2.6 million pharmacists and pharmacist personnel, and over 1.3 million community personnel.__

## Industry Details, Size & Major Players

#### <B>Industry Details</B> <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag622.htm#:~:text=The%20hospitals%20subsector%20is%20part,accommodation%20services%20required%20by%20inpatients">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>:
The hospital industry provides medical, diagnostic, and treatment services that include physician, nursing, and other health services to inpatients and the specialized accommodation services required by inpatients. Hospitals may also provide outpatient services as a secondary activity. Establishments in the Hospitals subsector provide inpatient health services, many of which can only be provided using the specialized facilities and equipment that form a significant and integral part of the production process.

#### <B> Industry Size and Key Players </B> <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/us-hospital-facilities-market">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. hospital facilities market size was estimated at <B>USD 1,318.9 billion in 2021</B> and was estimated at <B>USD 1,411.7 billion in 2022</B>.</li> 
<li>Some major players operating in the U.S. hospital facilities market include The John Hopkins Hospital, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Cedars-Sinai, Massachusetts General Hospital, UCSF Health, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, and Northwestern Memorial Hospital</li>
</ul>

## Significance of Information Technology 
<ul>
<li>Patient information is collected from various healthcare sources, including hospitals, emergency and home care services, and contains crucial information about diagnoses. This information may include personal details such as names, addresses, age, family history, and social security numbers. As a result, healthcare data is a prime target for cyber attacks, and it is crucial to have proper cybersecurity measures in place to protect it.
</li>
<li>The healthcare industry has been facing persistent cyberattacks since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The CyberPeace Institute has studied data from 33 countries and analyzed over 235 cyberattacks, excluding data breaches, on the healthcare sector. These attacks have resulted in the theft of more than 10 million records, which include private information like social security numbers, medical records, financial data, and confidential information of medical donors. On average, each attack breaches around 155,000 records, but some incidents have caused the breach of over 3 million records.
</li>
<li>Information technology personnel and expertise is critical to protect hospital technologies. Understanding the threat landscape facing the industry is very important for protecting the critical assets of the industry and its companies
