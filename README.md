## [↑](#table-of-contents) Diamond Models

The purpose of the Diamond Model is to assist analysts in identifying a group of events that occurred on their systems. These occurrences can then be grouped together in time to form “activity threads,” which can be compared to detect attacker campaigns.

Some information security experts use the diamond model  to authenticate and trace <B>cyber threats</B>. Every incidence can be represented as a diamond using this method. 

The relationships and features of four diamond components — <B> adversary, capacity, infrastructure, and victim </B> — are highlighted by this methodology. These four main elements are linked together to define their relationship, which may be analyzed to gain further insights and knowledge about malicious behaviors. 

* <B>Adversary:</B> An adversary is an organization or threat actor that uses a capacity against a victim to achieve its objectives. 
* <B>Capability:</B> The tools and strategies utilized by an opponent in an event are referred to as capabilities. 
* <B>Infrastructure:</B> The infrastructure refers to the physical or logical communication structures used by an adversary to supply a capability, such as IP or e-mail addresses, domain names, etc. 
* <B>Victim:</B> A victim is someone who has been attacked, has vulnerabilities exploited, or has capabilities utilized against them. Organizations, people, or assets, e-mail or IP addresses, domain names, and so on can all be targets.

## [↑](#table-of-contents) Data Source Identification and Justification

We have identified two data sources for cyber threats : <B> 1. Malware Bazaar  2. PhishTank </B>

### 1. Malware Bazaar:

* It is a free, community-driven repository of malware samples and research data for cybersecurity professionals and researchers. Created by Abuse.ch it provides over 15 million malware samples in its repository.

* As it was previously mentioned, ransomware is a type of malware that poses a big threat to healthcare organizations. Malware Bazaar can be used to specifically analyze ransomware samples to protect organizations.

* There are 3 main use cases for this data source selection<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="https://bazaar.abuse.ch/about/">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>:

  * <B>Threat Intelligence</B>: it is continuously updated by all the members of the community, which provides information about the latest threats and will allow the organization to be prepared.
  * <B>Malware analysis</B>: downloading and studying different malware examples can help the design of effective countermeasures against similar threats.
  * <B>IOCs (indicators of compromise)</B>: Malware Bazaar provides a database of IOCs associated with various malware samples

### 2. PhishTank:

* <B>Accessibility</B> : PhishTank is an open-source platform that is utilized by various security firms, including McAffee, Kaspersky, and Avira, to cater to both the general public and healthcare industry. It serves as the primary data repository for phishing attacks.

* <B>Quality and Relevance</B> : PhishTank is a platform where users can report suspected phishing scams and keep track of their reports. For a phishing scam to be added to the database, it needs to be reported by multiple users. The platform is regularly updated with new data to address new threats, and it monitors various industries, not just healthcare, to provide a complete overview of potential phishing attacks.

* <B> Reason for selection of this data source </B> : According to our four Diamond Models, Phishing is a significant threat that has been increasing in prevalence every year. Tessian research in 2021 shows that employees, on average, receive 14 malicious emails annually. Phishing attacks are highly successful, with at least one person clicking on a phishing link in 86% of organizations, according to Cisco's 2021 Cybersecurity threat trend report. In the healthcare industry, hospitals can be targeted, and potential victims may include hospital administrative data, staff and patient data, and patient medical records.

## [↑](#table-of-contents) Data Collection Strategies

### 1. Malware Bazaar
* First, the site provides a full list of all the malwares it has registered, which can either be downloaded completely or only the most recent ones. This can be done using a simple python script like this one:

![MB-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai4cyberiu/ai4cyberiu.github.io/main/Malware-Bazaar-1.png "MB-1")

* In this case, the data is being saved in a .csv file, but it can also be saved in a database for easier access.
* The downloaded dataset looks as follows:

![MB-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai4cyberiu/ai4cyberiu.github.io/main/Malware-Bazaar-2.png "MB-2")

* Metadata Information:

![MB-3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai4cyberiu/ai4cyberiu.github.io/main/Malware-Bazaar-3.png "MB-3")

* The shown dataset is very useful by itself because it will enable AI4Cyber models to be trained on the latest threats and how big their impact may be.

* To get the most out of Malware Bazaar, an important additional process will be needed:

  * When the AI model identifies a threat in a malware (mainly ransomwares in this case), the program must download a sample of it from Malware Bazaar’s API (free).
  * Once downloaded, the program must analyze the malware in depth, providing actionable information (or automation) to prevent any issues.
  * This analysis can be stored in another database to continue training the model.
  * To go even further, the resulting analysis can be uploaded to Malware Bazaar to close the loop and help other organizations.

### 2. PhishTank Data Sample

* The information was obtained by downloading a csv file from PhishTank website<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="https://phishtank.org/developer_info.php">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>, making it straightforward to examine. The dataset contains roughly 60000 entries.

![PT-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai4cyberiu/ai4cyberiu.github.io/main/PhishTank-1.png "PT-1")

* Metadata (Column) Information : 

  * phish_detail_url - PhishTank detail URL for the phish, where you can view data about the phish, including a screenshot and the community votes.
  * URL - The phish URL. This is always a string, and in the XML feeds may be a CDATA block.
submission_time - The date and time at which this phish was reported to PhishTank. This is an ISO 8601 formatted date.
  * verified  - Whether or not this phish has been verified by our community. In these data files, this will always be the string 'yes' since we only supply verified phishes in these files.
  * verification_time  - The date and time at which the phish was verified as valid by our community. This is an ISO 8601 formatted date.
  * online - Whether or not the phish is online and operational. In these data files, this will always be the string 'yes' since we only supply online phishes in these files.
  * target - The name of the company or brand the phish is impersonating, if it's known.
  
* First, the site provides a full list of all the malwares it has registered, which can either be downloaded complete or only the most recent ones. This can be done using a simple python script like this one:

![PT-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai4cyberiu/ai4cyberiu.github.io/main/PhishTank-2.png "PT-2")

* In this case, the data is being saved in a .csv file, but it can also be saved in a database for easier access.

* PhishTank is a community-driven platform that collects and shares information about phishing attacks. The platform is designed to help organizations and individuals identify and prevent phishing attacks, which are one of the most common types of cyber threats.

* The PhishTank dataset can be very useful in training AI4Cyber models to detect and prevent phishing attacks. To get the most out of PhishTank, an additional process will be needed:

  * When the AI model identifies a suspicious email or URL, the program must query the PhishTank API (free) to check if it has been reported as a phishing attack.
  * If the email or URL is found in the PhishTank database, the program should provide actionable information to prevent any issues, such as blocking the email or warning the user not to click the link.
  * This analysis can be stored in another database to continue training the model.
  * To close the loop, the resulting analysis can be uploaded to PhishTank to help other organizations and individuals identify and prevent phishing attacks. By contributing to the community-driven platform, organizations can help each other to create a safer online environment for everyone.

## [↑](#table-of-contents) Analytical Approaches and Justification

For our case study, we have determined following analytical approaches for each of the data set

1. **PhishTank Data set** : We have considered two analytical approaches, namely
* <B> Approach 1</B> - Predictive analysis using classification techniques for phishing URL patterns. Python models were trained to perform predictive analysis.
* <B> Approach 2</B> - Forensic Analytics Process for phishing data focusing on source, targets and number of attempts. Power BI tool was used to analyze the data.

2. **Malware dataset** : We will be using <B>static</B> and <B>dynamic</B> models for <B>“Malware Analysis”</B> technique

### PhishTank Analytics - Approach 1

* **Reason**: The purpose of utilizing PhishTank data is to easily determine whether a URL is associated with phishing or not. The dataset provided by PhishTank consists of known URLs used for phishing, which is valuable for identifying potential phishing sites that could pose a risk to our network. The objective is to identify the characteristics of phishing sites to improve our overall ability to detect such sites.
* **Importance in the Industry**: Phishing is the most effective method employed by malicious individuals to gain unauthorized access to networks. By gaining a deeper understanding of the attributes exhibited by phishing sites, organizations can take proactive measures, such as deploying firewalls or spam filters, to prevent attacks and protect their enterprise.
