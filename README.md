#### <B>Our Focus</B>:
<B>Healthcare Facilities (Hospitals) </B>

__Key services within the hospital industry include, hospitals, clinics, labs, psychiatric facilities, and nursing homes. These services are provided by millions of providers globally. Approximately 9.2 Million physicians, 19.4 millions nurses and midwives, 1.9 million dentist and dentistry personnel, 2.6 million pharmacists and pharmacist personnel, and over 1.3 million community personnel.__

The hospital industry provides medical, diagnostic, and treatment services that include physician, nursing, and other health services to inpatients and the specialized accommodation services required by inpatients. Hospitals may also provide outpatient services as a secondary activity. Establishments in the Hospitals subsector provide inpatient health services, many of which can only be provided using the specialized facilities and equipment that form a significant and integral part of the production process.

<ul>
<li>The U.S. hospital facilities market size was estimated at <B>USD 1,318.9 billion in 2021</B> and was estimated at <B>USD 1,411.7 billion in 2022</B>.</li> 
<li>Some major players operating in the U.S. hospital facilities market include The John Hopkins Hospital, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Cedars-Sinai, Massachusetts General Hospital, UCSF Health, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, and Northwestern Memorial Hospital</li>
</ul>

## [↑](#table-of-contents) Significance Of Information Technology 
<ul>
<li>Patient information is collected from various healthcare sources, including hospitals, emergency and home care services, and contains crucial information about diagnoses. This information may include personal details such as names, addresses, age, family history, and social security numbers. As a result, healthcare data is a prime target for cyber attacks, and it is crucial to have proper cybersecurity measures in place to protect it.
</li>
<li>The healthcare industry has been facing persistent cyberattacks since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The CyberPeace Institute has studied data from 33 countries and analyzed over 235 cyberattacks, excluding data breaches, on the healthcare sector. These attacks have resulted in the theft of more than 10 million records, which include private information like social security numbers, medical records, financial data, and confidential information of medical donors. On average, each attack breaches around 155,000 records, but some incidents have caused the breach of over 3 million records.
</li>
<li>Information technology personnel and expertise is critical to protect hospital technologies. Understanding the threat landscape facing the industry is very important for protecting the critical assets of the industry and its companies

## [↑](#table-of-contents) Diamond Models

The purpose of the Diamond Model is to assist analysts in identifying a group of events that occurred on their systems. These occurrences can then be grouped together in time to form “activity threads,” which can be compared to detect attacker campaigns.

Some information security experts use the diamond model  to authenticate and trace <B>cyber threats</B>. Every incidence can be represented as a diamond using this method. 

The relationships and features of four diamond components — <B> adversary, capacity, infrastructure, and victim </B> — are highlighted by this methodology. These four main elements are linked together to define their relationship, which may be analyzed to gain further insights and knowledge about malicious behaviors. 

* <B>Adversary:</B> An adversary is an organization or threat actor that uses a capacity against a victim to achieve its objectives. 
* <B>Capability:</B> The tools and strategies utilized by an opponent in an event are referred to as capabilities. 
* <B>Infrastructure:</B> The infrastructure refers to the physical or logical communication structures used by an adversary to supply a capability, such as IP or e-mail addresses, domain names, etc. 
* <B>Victim:</B> A victim is someone who has been attacked, has vulnerabilities exploited, or has capabilities utilized against them. Organizations, people, or assets, e-mail or IP addresses, domain names, and so on can all be targets.

Furthermore, there are global threats from nation-states, such as China and Russia, who have sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to attack healthcare organizations in the past. These threats can come from local actors, such as employees who access protected data, or global actors like nation-states attempting to breach secure systems.

## [↑](#table-of-contents) Data Source Identification and Justification

We have identified two data sources for cyber threats : <B> 1. Malware Bazaar  2. PhishTank </B>

### 1. Malware Bazaar:

* It is a free, community-driven repository of malware samples and research data for cybersecurity professionals and researchers. Created by Abuse.ch it provides over 15 million malware samples in its repository.

* As it was previously mentioned, ransomware is a type of malware that poses a big threat to healthcare organizations. Malware Bazaar can be used to specifically analyze ransomware samples to protect organizations.

* There are 3 main use cases for this data source selection<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="https://bazaar.abuse.ch/about/">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>:

  * <B>Threat Intelligence</B>: it is continuously updated by all the members of the community, which provides information about the latest threats and will allow the organization to be prepared.
  * <B>Malware analysis</B>: downloading and studying different malware examples can help the design of effective countermeasures against similar threats.
  * <B>IOCs (indicators of compromise)</B>: Malware Bazaar provides a database of IOCs associated with various malware samples

### 2. PhishTank:

* <B>Accessibility</B> : PhishTank is an open-source platform that is utilized by various security firms, including McAffee, Kaspersky, and Avira, to cater to both the general public and healthcare industry. It serves as the primary data repository for phishing attacks.

* <B>Quality and Relevance</B> : PhishTank is a platform where users can report suspected phishing scams and keep track of their reports. For a phishing scam to be added to the database, it needs to be reported by multiple users. The platform is regularly updated with new data to address new threats, and it monitors various industries, not just healthcare, to provide a complete overview of potential phishing attacks.

* <B> Reason for selection of this data source </B> : According to our four Diamond Models, Phishing is a significant threat that has been increasing in prevalence every year. Tessian research in 2021 shows that employees, on average, receive 14 malicious emails annually. Phishing attacks are highly successful, with at least one person clicking on a phishing link in 86% of organizations, according to Cisco's 2021 Cybersecurity threat trend report. In the healthcare industry, hospitals can be targeted, and potential victims may include hospital administrative data, staff and patient data, and patient medical records.
